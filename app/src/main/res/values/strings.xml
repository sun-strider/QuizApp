    <string name="question_2">What are properties of bases?</string>
    <string name="answer_7">Slippery</string>
    <string name="answer_8">Sour</string>
    <string name="answer_9">Bitter</string>
    <string name="answer_10">pH &#62; 7</string>

    <string name="question_3">According to definitions of acids and bases by Lewis:</string>
    <string name="answer_13">Acids are electron pair acceptors and bases are donors</string>
    <string name="answer_14">Acids are electron pair donors and bases are acceptors</string>


    <string name="question_4">In the formula for pH, the concentration of hydronium (H3O+) ions can
        be approximatly swapped for the concentration of the dissolved substance. This is true for:</string>
    <string name="answer_15">Strong acids</string>
    <string name="answer_16">Weak acids</string>
    <string name="answer_17">Strong bases</string>
    <string name="answer_18">Weak bases</string>

    <string name="question_5">Please explain why the above can be done? Hint: How will the reaction go when dissolved in water?</string>
    <string name="free_text_answer_hint_1">Enter your answer here. It will be sent by mail and separatly scored</string>

    <string name="question_6">A relative simple calculation as above can also be done for the respectice opposite (e.g. either stron/weak base/acid)
         How should the pH then be calculated?</string>
    <string name="answer_19">14 - [substance]</string>
    <string name="answer_20">14 - log [substance]</string>
    <string name="answer_21">0 + log [substance]</string>
    <string name="answer_22">14 + log [substance]</string>
